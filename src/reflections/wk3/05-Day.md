## Ramblings

THe MVC pattern seems very useful, it organizes things rather nicely and I find it makes my programming much more efficient, where before I was just trying to make something work, with this I am actually able to put effort into making it work well. Which has already reduced some of the frustration that comes with needing to debug. I still struggle a bit with pushing things to the service page, as most of what we do is just writing to the DOM I find myself almost sticking to the controllers, which is something I'll need to fix going forward. The break was too long, I was able to sort of keep up programming every once in a while, but definitely not as much as I should have. I'm hoping that what I've done is enough to get back into the swing of things, but this next week will probably be pretty rough.
