## Making a plan

It is good to make a plan, because like every single other discipline, coding is a complicated process. Even if you jave an idea of how things should fit together for a program to work, with out writing it down and coming up with a framework. When it comes time to start putting things on the computer it can get messy and complicated in the worse way. Planning is good to help prevent mistakes, and save time in the long run by increasing efficieny.

## Searching for an answer

Step one is error messages. The red line of doom almost always has a bit of insight into what you're doing wrong. Next, take a step back. Go use the bathroom, get a drink, go for a walk, etc... The human mind will continue to run calculations in the background. I'm only three weeks (a month and a half counting the online intro course) into programming and the sheer number of times I have come to a realization on why my code isn't working while taking a whizz is insane. I also like to take a step back write it out and try to think of maybe a different solution. And if all else fails google it. The collective of human understanding should be able to at least point you in the right direction.

## Takeaways

One of my biggest takeaways is how little I know about coding. I'm excited just to get what I'm writing to work, and this article goes into a thousand ways I'm doing it wrong, several of it's points hitting a little too close to home. The author also really stresses readable code, writing it in such a way that someone else could look at it and understand what I was going for, and why I did it how I did. Before this I was already falling into naming my variables just whatever, but I will make an effort to have my binding make at least a little bit of sense.
