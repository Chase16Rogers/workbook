## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

In a smaller team they are able to communicate more intimately, which could make longer more thurough meetings less necessary than it would be for a large team. A smaller team will also have tighter margins which means time is money in the strictest sense, time they spend not moving towards their goal is money and resources not being utilized fully. So they might make their meetings smaller, and go over the more important topics and trust their team to bring up road blocks as they encounter them.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only 1 sprint at a time?

Because that is what is humanly achievable/what will lead to the most efficient MVP. Because the whole point of SCRUM is making "small" pushes that lead to a marketable product, trying to manage two sprints at a time could lead to neither being met. 

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

The unattainable triangle is a concept that describes the benefits between balancing the speed of development and the quality of the final product. Ultimately the faster something is built the sloppier it will be. In scrum this plays a huge role. Because scrum is done in increments achieving a usable product is potentially usually something that occurs early on, then it is improved upon as more and more sprints take place. This allows the heads to pull the plug whenever they are satisfied with the product, while keeping overheads/wasted time minimal.
