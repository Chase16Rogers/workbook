## Ramblings

Overall I feel like this whole capstone-hackathon process has been incredibly valuable. We got into some pretty cool things once we had an MVP, googlemaps, Mongoose geolocation, and sockets to name a few. I feel like I was challenged as a software developer and at least a little bit as a person. I'm definitely not much of a people person, so having to coordinate as a group was a good challenge and a way for me to step out of my comfort zone (in a small way, I'm already decently used to working with others after my experiences before Boise Codeworks). I feel like I was able to really cement what I have learned up to this point and would go so far as to say that I am comfortable with vue and node, and extremely familiar with JavaScript.
