## My take on wireframe

In writing, you start with a rough draft, just putting ideas on paper. Then through editing and revision the draft loses it's roughness until you are left with a "smooth" draft. In essence a wireframe is the rough draft of a website. It lets the developer visualize what the site might look like so they have a place to start. More and more I've come to realize the importance of having a plan and good structure, the first project I did by "myself" (BoiseCodeworks did almost all of the layout) amd the little bit of html I had to write was just a mess of divs, I couldn't get half of the classes I used to actually do what they were meant to do. If I had planned ahead better, thought through exactly how I want everything to work, then maybe I would've been more pleased with the final product. 

## A good wire-frame is like a good pair of headphones 
<small>Strictly in the sense that headphones also use fidelity as a descriptor</small>
  #### Low-fi

  Low fidelity is the simplest most basic fidelity of the fidelities. It was described as a quick drawing on a piece of paper. This is really only good for large content. Like where you want to put an image, or where text should go. This is good for large decision making, and comunicating with our less tech savy brethren. Instead of trying to describe the image in our head we can just draw it. 

  #### Mid-fi

  Medium fidelity is like the best of both worlds. It's a low commitment wire-frame, you spend less than an hour on it, but it shows you exactly what elements go where. Maybe you don't use the exact colors and specific fonts you'll use in your final webpage, but you can establish prominince. This one is particularly good because it really starts bringing things together. It didn't take very much time, so changes aren't too unreasonable, but it looks good enough to really establish, and provide a solid backbone to the formatting, the div-ing of the html.

  #### High-fi<strike>ve</strike>

  High fidelity is high detail. It's pretty much a mock of what exactly the webpage will look like. This is the kind of wire-frame a design team gives the developers to recreate. It details even the more comlicated aspects, taking away any guesswork. 

## To wire-frame or not to wire-frame

That is the question. The answer is mostly yes to wire-frame. When your starting from scratch, and have nothing more to go off of than your imagination, putting that image into code cleanly and effectively is a tall challenge. But you draw some pictures, figure out your layout, and have an actual idea on how everything should look and layout. Honestly, that's where it should stop. I would "never" (provisionally) go above a mid-fidelity, because of the modularity, the sheer control I have in the document. Why spend time and effort making a pretty picture no one but myself will see, when I can spend that time fideling with css properties, trying to make the actual webpage, work and look nice.
