## Ramblings

I've really been enjoying c# and sql, it's been a pretty easy transition from javascript and node. Which is probably thanks to the similarities in the frameworks we've been using. Its still at least the basic Express hallways we use for routing our server, we still use MVC to control the flow of our code. The biggest challenge for me was getting my head around the fact that I can't use POJOS and arrays like I could in JavaScript. I didn't realize how convenient they were until I had already lost them. Now that I'm a little bit used to the open and broad concept that is storing data in a list it's been going much more smoothly.
