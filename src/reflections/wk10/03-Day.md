## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed implicit values. My understanding it is the same as using const to bind, because you give a value that you then never alter. This is useful for making code more readable. Instead of using numbers to represent singular concepts, you can bind that number to an understandable name to make it more readable.

## How can you modify an Enum?

It seems the most essential way to modify an enum is by hard changing the value given to it at declaration. Because having an enum who's value can change if you typo and only use one = in a conditional (or some other typo) would be pretty useless, because all of it's checks after that would be dependant on what it changed to rather than the expected value.

##  How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?

I honestly haven't used enums at all yet. I've come close in that I will sometimes bind a number to a name that I then use in conditionals, like for rock paper scissors rock == 1, paper == 2, scissors == 3, which I then used for the logic of my game because frankly I had a much easier time keeping track of which number belonged to which binding, instead of vice versa,
