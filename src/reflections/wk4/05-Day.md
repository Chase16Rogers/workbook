## Ramblings

This week felt, honestly incredibly slow. We were introduced to a very small number of concepts, it feels like the entire week was spent on get, put, post, and delete. I can understand somewhat that we needed to get accostomed to using APIs, and by this point I trust codeworks to set a good pace to allow the most number of students to succeed, but it still felt, slow. I really enjoyed the pokedex project, mostly because I'm on a pretty big pokemon nostalgia kick at the moment, going back and playing my old games. I also really look forward to this upcoming week, because of the challenge, the widening of my knowledge that will come with writing a server. At this point I feel like I have a good understanding of what we've gone over so far, my CSS is still pretty lame, but I've been messing around more with writing my own for more specific/useful styling, rather than just trying to make the bootstrap helpers work. While I feel pretty confident about my understanding, at the same time the bugs I do run into often stump me, especially in relation to interracting with the server. Is the mistake something I did (probably), is there some problem with my network connection, did some magic happen between the application and the server to screw me over? I honestly don't know enough, to entirely wrap my head around all of the things that could go wrong to give me an error message. Hopefully that will change with time as I learn a wider and more indepth knowledge of programming.
