## Representational State Transfer

REST stands for Representational State Transfer, this is the standardization for website comumnication with a server. By this method, essentially an API is established for the server, and all this does is store information. Then when a website needs to access the information on the server it can do so only by the, get put post delete, methods. 

## Stateless

Stateless means the burden of request is on the application. The server does not store, generate, or maintain in anyway(they probably keep some sort of anlytics) the information that is requested by a user, how many times that user has made a request, and what they are requesting. The server simply recieves a request that should have all necessary components, and returns whatever data that was requested.

## URL Pattern

The URL pattern of an API is rather simple in design. It contains the usual " https:// " to initiate communication with the web, second the domain of wherever the Api is hosted, then it uses a " / " means by which to navigate / specify where the exact data needed is.
