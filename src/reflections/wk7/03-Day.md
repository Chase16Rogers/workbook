## UX

A user experience is a cumulation of every interaction any one (other than the developer/owner) makes with an application. It's the experience, the emotional takeaway, how they felt using an application. As a developer it is important to take into account the feelings of the user, what you want them to feel, and what they want from the application. Tailoring the design, flow, and functionality of the website to make a user more likely to use the website again is the goal in UX.

## Benefits of taking UX into account

Ultimately the whole point of creating an application is for some end-user at some point to use it. But if it is convoluted, difficult to use, and aesthetically unpleasing, the end user isn't going to want to use your application. If a end user wouldn't want to use it, all of your programming is essentially worthless. So by taking into account UX you can plan and code around making your application actually viable in a competitive market. 

## Why UX is important

UX is kind of the prime-ultimate tool for marketing. The ultimate goal for everything is to make money. The client wants money and the developer wants money. By taking UX into consideration it is possible to influence end-users, by giving them a positive experience they are more likely to continue using your website. By controlling colors, button placement, or navigation in certain areas you can make the user more likely to spend money, and more likely to visit the website again. A website is in many ways the face of a business, so by having a good looking website with a good UX it can improve opinions of the website.
