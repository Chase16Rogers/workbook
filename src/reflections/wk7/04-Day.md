# Day 4
__01/21/21__

## What principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We definitely used pair programming, there was never a point at which only one of us was working on the code. I definitely tried to increase my communication, just constantly rattling off what I was thinking, what I thought we should do, and how I would do it. We definitely weren't great about documentation (I don't think we did any, outside of some ok naming conventions). We tried to take UX into consideration, it was probably rough around the edges, but we put considerable time into thinking, "does this look nice?, how does this effect other components on the page?, is this easy/clear to use?" Things went very well, but it definitely could have been better.

## What went well?

We worked really well together and were able to come up with an MVP by the second day. We both had a very similar mindset where we were more goal oriented, lets get passing before we spend a lot of time making it look nice and clearing up all of the bugs. We were able to make changes to the server as we went along and had relatively few issues CRUD'ing' from the client. 

## What would you do differently?

I think we should have planned out more exactly which steps we would take in which order. We started with server, and  were able to move to the client and get things done pretty well, but there was a bit of floundering once we reached the point where it was technically up to snuff. We learned some cool stuff in class, but besides some messing around with cascade deleting we weren't willing to experiment with our functional code, I wish we had created a development branch and really gone for some potentially breaking changes. We spent a lot of time trying to make it look nicer and fixing some little bugs that didn't really matter. We should have pooled our combined brain power into learning some of these new things.
