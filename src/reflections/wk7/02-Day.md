## Code Documentation

Code documentation is simply the means by which a developer makes notes on how his code works. This makes it easier for other developers to figure out what is going on, and easier for the developer to come back to the project in the future after they've forgotten about how it works. There are many wayd to document code. First off, you could write a README, this is a document that gives a brief explanation of the application, its functions, and any changes made to it. You can also just write comments right in the code, this allows for a person reading the code to know what is being referenced by the comment simply by its location. The comments also allow for intricate referencing, setting data types, and attatching all sorts of information that can be accessed in future refrences.

##  Benefitting from code documentation

The most obvious benefit is readability. By documenting your code it makes it much easier for someone not familiar with it to read and understand what is going on. This is extremely important because in practice it is incredibly common for code to pass hands, from the initial creator to the team who will be maintaining, or from the person who was maintaining it to their replacement. Documenting can also increase efficency, as your going along it wouldn't be too unreasonable to forget what a particular method does, or what properties a model needs in order to function properly. By using good documentation practice it can save a lot of time and headache.

## The importance of documentation

I feel like I explained the importance of documentation in my description of benefits, but it is important because in practical code readability matters alot. For a senior to perform a code review, they need to be able to read it, and if it unreadable even to them it probably wouldn't be accepted. Second it requires you to put effort into the S in the SOLID principles, in order to describe what a function does, it needs to be single purposed. Documentation makes your code more transparent and usable, which makes it more valuable to clients and employers. Good documentation also improves efficiency which, in a world where time is money, is invaluable.
