## Ramblings

Overall this week went very well. I entered the week with a lot of anxiety, who would I partner with, how would we work together? I am extremely introverted so it's always a challenge spending such a large amount of time with a person that I don't really have the time to get to know. With this as well we both are at the same point where we only barely know what we are dong, so neither of us could particularly steer the group. Of course that didn't stop me because my "proffessional" persona is a rather bossy person who likes to take the lead. I felt like I steam rolled my partner for a lot of the project, but I wouldn't know how else to approach the assignment or handle myself in a situation where my partner isn't able (or willing?) to push back against my 'get it done' personality. Probably something for me to work on going forward, but we did get it done.
