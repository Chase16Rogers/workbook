## Pair Programming

Pair programming consists of two programmers working at a single computer. One person, the 'driver' types, they handle the syntax and execution of the exact coding happening at the moment. The other person, the 'navigator' keeps track of where the code is at and thinks ahead to solve problems before the driver can get to them. The navigator keeps things focused and watches for mistakes the driver will probably make.

## Benefits

Some of the benefits that come from pair programming include reduced errors, which leads to lest time being spent on debugging. By having two pairs of eyes watching the same code, it's much more likely someone will notice when a typo occurs, or some other error. By having a navigator to keep things rolling the actual coding should almost never need to take a break while the programmer works out a solution to a particular problem. Finally this forces the programmers to communicate, which makes the functionality of the code more clear, tangents more obvious, and two minds are always better than one.

## Downfalls

One of the most obvious downfalls is the fact that it takes two staff members to achieve pair programming, paying two people to do the same task. While studies have shown there is a relatively negligible overhead involved, the costs still increase, and if one of the programmers isn't able to fully participate because of a bad day or whatever circumstances may be involved, the benefits are almost negligible and you recieve an inferior product at a higher cost. Finally this requires a relationship between the developers, if they aren't able to communicate well, if they don't have good chemistry it could lead to mitigated results.
