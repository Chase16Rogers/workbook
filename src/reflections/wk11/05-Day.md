## Ramblings

When the final project was first introduced it seemed really intimidating, but once I got going on the server I came to the conclusion that it is very doable. I'm a little dissapointed that all of the planning was already figured out, as now I don't feel as intimately involved with the whole thing, but at the same time figuring out the relationships is probably the hardest part so I'm a little glad to just be given a working model. Also a little dissapointed that we were just straight up given a really nice figma. I was looking into material design and had this big idea about how I would figure out how to design it. But honestly I would be a fool if I didn't try to emulate the example I already have, saving myself not only the time and effort, but also design is one of my biggest weaknesses in this whole process. I just don't have an eye for it.
