## Course reflections (what have I enjoyed most) and plan of attack for final (time management).

Taking this program was honestly one of the best decisions I've ever made. I not only love what we're learning, but I feel like I really understand what we've gone over. I honestly believe that I am at a point now where I can at least figure out "anything" in programming with a bit of effort. I love how much respect I was given as a student, being treated like an actual human being was almost a shock after some of my experiences in traditional school. I think I still have a long way to go before I'm at the level of the instructors, which for now is what I will strive towards, but I have confidence in getting to that point someday.

As far as the final goes I will plan to have the server done by the end of monday, so I can spend the rest of the week figuring out the front end. I'll plan on spending at least a couple hours at home each night, but I'm not too worried about finishing if I'm being completely honest.
