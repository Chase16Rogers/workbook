## Virtually a Property

A virtual property is simply a logical continuation of the information stored on actual properties. The example given is a person's full name. A data base might want to store a person's first and last name seperately to give the convenience of freedom of choice, maybe they use the first name in a casual greeting message, but the last name when sending a more formal message. Instead of storing a third property that combines the two strings, it would be more efficient(space wise) to simply concatenate the two when it is necessary to use a person's full name for those potentially outlier situations.

## Virtual properties in my code

Honestly, at this point my understanding is shallow enough that I don't think much of virtual properties, it seems like a mostly unecessary step, but I could maybe see it in instances like gregslist. Instead of drawing the make and model for a car listing seperately, I could make a virtual property of make and model. Because in the real world they are almost always mentioned together, and anytime I drew them they would be together anyways. But it wasn't very much effort whatsoever to draw them seperately.

## It's a trap!

It is not possible to make a search using a virtual property! Mayhaps you could derive one of its contributing values to then make a query, but that would be a ridiculous waste of TEE. It's much better to make a search using existing properties, that you would already know if you had access to a virtual property.
