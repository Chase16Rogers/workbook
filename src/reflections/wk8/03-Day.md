## What is software development testing

Testing is a process by which your code is "challenged" to see if there is anything that breaks, or could be dangerous to consumers. This day and age privacy is key, so if your software allows for some loophole shenanigans it could be devastating to the business that hired you. Also sloppy/not-funcitonal code will make a bad impression on end-users, which could also hinder your clients. SO testing is important to ensure a certain level of quality to protect yourself and your clients.

## What are the benefits to testing software

Testing software can greatly increase efficiency. Instead of trying to debug after the fact, by testing as you go you can avoid pushing breaking code. Maybe the code you wrote allows for some privacy violations, but you didn't realize, by testing you could potentially discover this before a malicious person does. Also by testing you can be sure to not break an in-use application. For businesses nowadays more than ever time is money and their websites need to be up 24/7, so as a software developer if I crash their system I could quickly find myself in hot water. Like millions of dollars of hot water.

## What are some drawbacks to testing

First of all someone will have to write the tests, which is time and money not spent on incrementing the product. Second the person writing the tests is still entirely fallible, even a dedicated team could still miss some items, which in turn could give developers a false sense of security. "Well, it passed the test so it must be good" So if the tests aren't precise it could end up having difficult repricussions down the line. Finally testing can reduce the speed at which code is written. If it is written poorly, or too indepth the developers might find themselves jumping through unnecessary hoops just to pass the test when the actual code necessary could be much more elegant.
