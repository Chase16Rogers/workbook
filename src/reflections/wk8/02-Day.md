## Why is communication on a small team important

Communication on a small team is as important as it is for a much larger team because of the inherit value of communication. This allows more effective development, prevents people from doing the same task twice, depending on where it takes place, like slack, it would allow an outsider to have an idea of where the team is at. Communication makes everything more efficient.

##  What adjustments from traditional teams need to be made to use the agile methodolgy effectively in a small team?

The biggest difference is a required constant state of communication. With a much smaller team, they have much tighter margins, which makes time spent in meetings time not creating their product. Smaller teams unfortunately have to narrow their scope and really focus on what they are able to do. They might not have the freedom to let their members spend time widening their skillsets when it is more efficient for the members to focus on their strengths. 

## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unattainable triangle is the necessary tradeoff between speed and quality. The faster you make something, enevitably the sloppier it will be. In software development as in most things the faster it takes to make an application, the less money development costs. Strictly in the sense that they are giving up certain functionalities, and qualities. While on the other side the longer a team has to work on a project, the more resources they have, they are able to produce a superior product with more functionality and better quality. Finding a balance in this to meet the needs of particularly the customer is an interesting challenge, something to think about, that has serious real-world implications.
