## What function does a portfolio provide

A portfolio serves as an example of what a software developer is capable of. Because they should include their most impressive projects, it is a way to "show off" what a developer knows and is capable of. Instead of just taking your word for what you can do, it provides a concrete example of your skills for potential employers.

##  What makes a developer portfolio effective

A portfolio should be made up of about five, give or take, quality projects. These projects should be a serious effort from the deveolper that demonstrate their skill. The biggest thing to make a portfolio stand out is having each of the projects be meaningful in some way, instead of just some generic application, you should be able to tell an interesting story during your interview.

## What projects do you have that you would include in your portfolio? Why?

The capstone we are currently working on, the partner project - Bug Report, bloggr checkpoint. I would use these projects because I believe they are my most impressive to date. No only that but 2/3 are group project which would allow me to bring up pair programming and demonstrates that I am able to achieve something with a team. I will definitely want to tidy up bug report with some of the new design concepts my capstone group has been learning.
