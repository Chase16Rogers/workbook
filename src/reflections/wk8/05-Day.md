## Ramblings

I think testing can be useful, but frankly I dislike the idea of stopping what i'm doing to write tests for something that I'm already familiar with. I know what something my brain cooked up needs, at least on the small scale I'm currently at. That being said I greatly appreciate tests written by other developers for existing project. This provides the backbone and security I need in order to keep me on track and forces me to meet the requirements that I otherwise might blow past.
