# Day 1

## Server blues...

Today went pretty well. My server was at a pretty good point coming out of the weekend so today I was going to focus on the relationship side of things. It went pretty well, things were mostly working and I was passing most of the tests. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why the get one vault wouldn't verify the logged in user. I triple checked the logic and everything made perfect sense, I even added a null check to the userinfo that would trigger a different path based on whether or not someone was logged in. I started passing the no-Auth test but failed the Auth test... I wasn't sure enough of why it was broken, and I didn't want to ask some babbling question so I figured I'd take a break from the server and write out a bit of the client. I made decent progress with the home page getting the keeps and looking a bit into card columns, but they were fighting me. Feeling good.
