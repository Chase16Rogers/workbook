## The end?

Well I passed my final. I did a lot of polishing. Figured out how to change the number of columns in my card columns, can delete keeps and vaults. Failed to private check getting keeps by vault, but that will be an easy fix. Messed around with pulling colors off of the figma. For the life of me couldn't figure out how to increase the specificity of an @click event. I even messed with the z-index... I mostly focused on trying to close the modal that was opening before it could open, trying to use a timeout and having them both point to the same method that then checked which element was clicked, but based solely on the arguments the @click provided. No bueno. But I passed. So feeling pretty good.
