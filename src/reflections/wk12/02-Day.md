## Can vue believe it?

I made excellent progress on the client today. Well, I made decent progress on the client today. It was going smoothly but I kept getting caught up in trying to get it to look nicely. Fiddling with margins and padding. First thing I did was test the server and it was still failing the tests, I messed around with it a little bit but ultimately couldn't figure out why it was so mad. It was giving me everything I was asking for so I got back going on the client. I got the keep modals going and the profile page mostly squared away in addition to creating keeps. Feeling a little bit worried.
