## MySql blues...

I forgot to include the isPrivate field on my database query in my repository. It was failing the tests and byoassing my logic checks because it could never be anything but public... Made good progress besides tearing my hair out over this. Have all of the basic components and pages done. Messed around with randomizing the sizes for the masonry look, kinda janky still, I should have done a background image and locked the aspect ratio, because they currently stretch to what size I tell it to be. Also messed around with dropdowns for adding keeps to a vault. Pretty cool day. Feeling pretty good. I only have a couple things left to passing the requirements.
